# ⛳️ 💸 🧙‍♂️ - Wise Transaction Wizard

Personal project to automatically extract monthly transactions from Wise and download them in a format that is important to me.

Rough guide to success:

```zsh
pnpm run install
pnpm run exec
```

## TO DO

- ~~Add multi balance support~~
- Add email support? Maybe a separate package.
- Add multi format support
- Allow to choose whether or not you want transaction fees separate
- Choose Language
- Add a `WISE Stamp of Approval`! 💮
- Add a README (sort of done, right?)
