# ⛳️ 💸 🧙‍♂️ - Wise Transaction Wizard

Personal project to automatically extract monthly transactions from Wise and download them in a format that is important to me.

Rough guide to success:

```zsh
pnpm run install
pnpm run exec
```

## TO DO

- Add multi balance support
- Add email support? Maybe a separate package.
- Add a README (sort of done, right?)
